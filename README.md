# P5.JS Snake

A snake game built using [P5.js](https://p5js.org) - a JS library that brings processing style commands to JS. I made this game over two evenings after watching [this video](https://youtu.be/AaGK-fj-BAM). My code is probably fairly similar as I made this directly after watching it.

I made this game mainly to improve my JS skills and learn a new library.

## How to play
Use the Arrow keys to move.  
Collect the "food" to grow the snake.  
Crashing into oneself is game over.  
The walls wrap around - ie if you go off one side you come back on the other.  

One can play it [here](http://static1.natfaulk.com/statics/p5.js-snake/index.html).
