# P5.JS Snake

A snake game built using [P5.js]: https://p5js.org - a JS library that brings processing style commands to JS. I made this game over two evenings after watching [this video]: https://youtu.be/AaGK-fj-BAM. My code is probably fairly similar as I made this directly after watching it.

I made this game mainly to improve my JS skills and learn a new library.
